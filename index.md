## About this Site

I am currently a Computer Engineering student at Iowa State University. I have created this website for fun, and to display some of the projects I have worked on.

I am always interested in trying out new technologies, and this website will be used to detail my experiences with these technologies, as well as be a place to showcase some of the projects I have worked on in my free time.

If you are interested in my work, find me on [Github](http://github.com/breber), [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/breber), or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/brian_reber).
