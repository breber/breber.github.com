			<h2>Twitter Picture Viewer</h2>
			<div style="float: left; display: inline;">
				<p>
					<b>Background</b>: Up until recently, the Twitter for Android app
					didn't have support for viewing images from popular image hosting
					sites such as Twitpic, YFrog, Plixi etc. It was frustrating to
					click on a link to an image, and be brought to the web browser to
					view the image. Oftentimes, the website it brought you to was not
					the mobile site, which only made the problem worse. I wanted to be
					able to view the images in a native app, without having to go to
					the web browser. In addition, I only wanted to see the image - the
					other information provided on the sites (like comments, pic views
					etc) was irrelevent.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Purpose</b>: To be able to view tweeted pictures in a native
					image viewer on the Android platform
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Support</b>: Currently, this app supports TwitPic, YFrog, Plixi,
					and PicPlz images. I will be adding support for other services as I
					run into the need for them.
