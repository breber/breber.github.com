			<p>To provide an easy way for people to track the
				maintenance/fuel-ups of their vehicles.</p>

			<p>There is always the option to just keep a vehicle log in the
				glove compartment of the vehicle, but the problem with this is that
				there is no way to see this unless you are in your vehicle. In
				addition, you have to perform calculations if you want to see
				average MPG, or cost per week or per month.</p>

			<p>When I decided to start working on this project, I wanted to
				come up with a solution that would allow people to easily add
				records to their database from their Android phone, and then view
				that data on the web as well. My other goal was to have it
				automatically calculate important information including average MPG,
				total cost of the vehicle (money spent after the purchase of the
				vehicle), cost per week, cost per month and cost per year.</p>
