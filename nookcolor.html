			<h2>Nook Color Review</h2>

                <p>So, the Android powered Nook color.</p>

                <p>First off, it is a nice device.  I like it.  It has a pretty good size screen - 
                it isn't overbearing in my opinion.  It isn't the fastest processor out there (stock 
                clocked at 800 MHz, but there are overclocking kernels out there that bring it to 
                about 1.3 GHz).  But for normal activities, it is perfectly fine.</p>

                <p>Installing Android isn't difficult.  You'd need to get a microSD card to install 
                a recovery on, which you can boot into and then flash different roms.  The cool 
                thing about a nook color is that you can boot and run an os right off the sd card 
                if you want to try something out without overriding your current installation.  
                I am currently running CyanogenMod, which is based on Gingerbread (Android 2.3).  
                I would like to run honeycomb (android 3.0), but Google hasn't (and probably will not) 
                release the source code for that, so the only honeycomb roms are based on the Android SDK. 
                I have tried out a couple honeycomb roms, and they aren't bad, but there is only so much 
                they can do without having the actual source to modify.  Although once Ice Cream 
                Sandwich comes out later this year, there will probably be a lot of roms based on that.  
                I am excited for that to happen.</p>

                <p>That's about all I can think of for now....in general, it is a good tablet for the price in my opinion...</p>
