			<h2>Coke Rewards for Android</h2>

                <h3>Purpose</h3> 
                
                <p>To provide an easy way for people to submit codes from the caps of Coca-Cola Products to their
                MyCokeRewards accounts without having to navigate around the Coke Rewards website.</p>
                
                <p>I have been using Coke Rewards for a while now, and I have always found it annoying to
                have to go to my computer and type in the code.  After their addition of a mobile website, it became
                a bit easier to submit codes, but I much prefer native apps over web apps.  So I figured I would try and
                figure out how their submission system worked, and then build an app that would allow users to submit
                codes.</p>
                
                <p>In order to do this, I downloaded their freely available Yahoo! widget, logged in and submitted a code
                while watching the web requests that were performed using Fiddler. In Fiddler, I was able to see that all they
                were doing was sending a POST request to their '/xmlrequest' endpoint with some XML (including user credentials and
                a few other items) as the POST body. In response, they sent back whether you were logged in, as well as information
                about how many points the user had, and whether the code submission was successful or not.</p>
                
                <p>Another experience I had while creating this app was including ads in it.  The AdMob jar file was very easy to use.
                All I needed to do was add an AdView to the layout, perform a simple initialization, and then it would serve up ads. In
                addition to ads, I have included the Google Analytics library in this project to see which buttons are being used the
                most, and how many exceptions occur in the login process and code submission process. It has been interesting seeing
                this aggregated data.</p>
                
                <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
                
                <p>Throughout this project, I have learned how to use many new technologies.</p>
