## Web-based SMS

### Purpose

When I am sitting at my computer and my phone vibrates, I don't really want to have to pick it up and respond to a text message on the little screen, when I have a full keyboard on my computer. Also, when I install a new operating system on my phone (or get a new phone), I still want to have my text messages.

I like the idea of Google Voice, but I don't want to switch my phone number to be able to use it effectively. Google Voice offers a nice web-based interface to view, send and respond to text messages. One problem with Google Voice is its lack of support for MMS messages (picture messages).

When I decided to start working on this project, I wanted to come up with a solution for all of these reasons.
