## Android/Web Vehicle Log

### Purpose

To provide an easy way for people to track the maintenance/fuel-ups of their vehicles.

There is always the option to just keep a vehicle log in the glove compartment of the vehicle, but the problem with this is that there is no way to see this unless you are in your vehicle. In addition, you have to perform calculations if you want to see average MPG, or cost per week or per month.

When I decided to start working on this project, I wanted to come up with a solution that would allow people to easily add records to their database from their Android phone, and then view that data on the web as well.  My other goal was to have it automatically calculate important information including average MPG, total cost of the vehicle (money spent after the purchase of the vehicle), cost per week, cost per month and cost per year.
