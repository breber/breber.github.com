				<p style="display: inline">Recently I started investigating
					Android Widget development. I have a fair amount of experience
					developing apps for Android, so I figured Widgets were the next
					thing on the list to try out. In general, widgets are not terribly
					difficult to make. All that is needed is an XML layout file (like
					any other layout you would make for an app), and a class that
					extends AppWidgetProvider. The class that extends AppWidgetProvider
					is what is called when the widget is supposed to update. In this
					class, all you essentially need to find the ids of the elements you
					want to update, and update them like you would update a UI object
					when writing an actual application.</p>
				<p>One of the challenging parts about Android development in
					general is developing for multiple screen sizes. Just because a
					widget may look good on my Droid Eris, doesn't mean it will look
					good on a Droid Incredible. The trick is to use relative sizes -
					using pixels to describe where something should be is not a good
					idea because each device is not guaranteed to have the same screen
					size/density. One way to do this is to use 'dip'
					(density-independent pixel) instead of pixel. This should make the
					app more screen-independent. For text, using 'sp' (scaled pixels)
					works well. This unit scales the pixes based on the preferred font
					size.</p>
				<p>Another challenge I ran into when developing my agenda widget
					was getting the widget to update on an appropriate schedule. The
					widget isn't very helpful if it displays events that happend in the
					past. I did some reading online and it looks like by default, a
					widget can update at an interval of no less than 30 minutes. I felt
					that this was too long, so the solution that made the most sense
					was to add an alarm. I was able to set the alarm to go off every 15
					minutes, and when it goes off, it sends an "UpdateWidget" intent.
					My widget listens for that intent, and would therefore update when
					it received that intent. I am still a bit sketchy on this updating
					technique, but in my field tests the widget updates correctly.</p>
				<p>So far, I have really enjoyed my time developing for Android.
					Next up, a full calendar widget!</p>
